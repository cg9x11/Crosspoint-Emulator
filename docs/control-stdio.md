# Emulator Control Stdio

The emulator now supports a persistent machine-readable control channel with `--control-stdio`.

## Start

```powershell
.\build\Release\crosspoint_emulator.exe --control-stdio
```

For realistic background-download or anti-rate-limit testing, raise the delay cap:

```powershell
.\build\Release\crosspoint_emulator.exe --control-stdio --delay-cap-ms 60000
```

For deterministic test runs, start from a clean emulator session state:

```powershell
.\build\Release\crosspoint_emulator.exe --control-stdio --reset-session
```

`--reset-session` clears runtime-generated `Online Library` downloads, tracked-series data, and cached EPUB state
under `sdcard/.crosspoint/`, while keeping installed plugins in `sdcard/.crosspoint/plugins/`.

After the first interactive screen is ready, the emulator emits a JSON event prefixed with `[SIMCTL]`:

```text
[SIMCTL] {"ok":true,"event":"ready","state":{...}}
```

## Commands

Send one command per line through stdin:

```text
GET_STATE
GET_SCREEN
TYPE_TEXT re zero
WAIT_MS 900
PRESS DOWN
RELEASE DOWN
RELEASE_ALL
HOLD LEFT 900

```

## Events

The emulator writes structured responses back to stdout, prefixed with `[SIMCTL]`:

```text
[SIMCTL] {"ok":true,"event":"state","state":{...}}
[SIMCTL] {"ok":true,"event":"screen","screen":{...}}
[SIMCTL] {"ok":true,"event":"text_typed","text":"re zero"}
[SIMCTL] {"ok":true,"event":"wait_started","waitType":"delay","value":"900ms","timeoutMs":900}
[SIMCTL] {"ok":true,"event":"wait_progress","waitType":"menu_item","value":"Online Library","elapsedMs":1000,"timeoutMs":30000,"state":{...}}
[SIMCTL] {"ok":true,"event":"wait_satisfied","waitType":"delay","value":"900","matched":"900ms","state":{...}}
[SIMCTL] {"ok":true,"event":"action_started","action":"hold","button":"LEFT","durationMs":900}
[SIMCTL] {"ok":true,"event":"action_completed","action":"hold","value":"","matched":"LEFT","state":{...}}
[SIMCTL] {"ok":true,"event":"tapped","button":"CONFIRM","durationMs":180}
[SIMCTL] {"ok":true,"event":"released_all"}
[SIMCTL] {"ok":true,"event":"action_started","action":"go_back","timeoutMs":10000}

[SIMCTL] {"ok":true,"event":"wait_started","waitType":"menu_item","value":"Online Library","timeoutMs":30000}
[SIMCTL] {"ok":true,"event":"wait_satisfied","waitType":"menu_item","value":"Online Library","matched":"Online Library","state":{...}}
[SIMCTL] {"ok":true,"event":"action_started","action":"activate_visible_list_item","value":"Hako"}
[SIMCTL] {"ok":true,"event":"action_completed","action":"activate_visible_list_item","value":"Hako","matched":"Hako","state":{...}}
[SIMCTL] {"ok":false,"event":"wait_timeout","waitType":"popup","value":"Download complete","state":{...}}
```

## State Shape

The returned `state` object contains:

```json
{
  "millis": 1229,
  "currentActivity": "Home",
  "pendingAction": "none",
  "pendingActivity": "",
  "stackActivities": [],
  "screen": {
    "activityName": "Home",
    "headerTitle": "",
    "headerSubtitle": "",
    "subHeaderLabel": "",
    "subHeaderRightLabel": "",
    "bodyPrimaryText": "",
    "bodySecondaryText": "",
    "bodyTertiaryText": "",
    "popupMessage": "",
    "buttonHints": {
      "btn1": "",
      "btn2": "Select",
      "btn3": "Up",
      "btn4": "Down"
    },
    "buttonMenu": {
      "selectedIndex": 0,
      "selectedLabel": "Browse Files",
      "labels": ["Browse Files", "Recent Books", "Online Library", "File Transfer", "Settings"]
    },
    "list": {
      "itemCount": 0,
      "selectedIndex": -1,
      "selectedVisibleIndex": -1,
      "selectedTitle": "",
      "selectedSubtitle": "",
      "selectedValue": "",
      "visibleItems": []
    }
  }
}
```

`GET_SCREEN` returns only the `screen` object when automation does not need the full process state.

Wait commands use case-insensitive substring matching:

- `WAIT_HEADER` checks `headerTitle` and `headerSubtitle`
- `WAIT_BODY` checks `bodyPrimaryText`, `bodySecondaryText`, and `bodyTertiaryText`
- `WAIT_LIST_ITEM` checks visible list item `title`, `subtitle`, and `value`
- `WAIT_MENU_ITEM` checks `buttonMenu.labels`
- `WAIT_SELECTED_LIST_ITEM` checks the currently selected visible list item
- `WAIT_SELECTED_MENU_ITEM` checks `buttonMenu.selectedLabel`
- `WAIT_POPUP` checks `popupMessage`

`WAIT_*` commands are barriers. If you pipe a full script into stdin, the emulator will pause later queued
commands until the active wait succeeds or times out. While a wait is still pending, the emulator emits
`wait_progress` roughly once per second with the latest compact `state`, so CLI harnesses can show what the
emulator is currently waiting on instead of appearing idle.

Before `ready` is emitted, mutating commands such as `ACTIVATE_VISIBLE_*`, `PRESS`, `TAP`, and `TYPE_TEXT` stay queued
instead of failing against the transient boot screen. Read-only inspection commands and `WAIT_*` commands still run
immediately, so a harness can safely begin with waits while startup settles.

Read-only inspection commands still pass through barriers:

- `GET_STATE`
- `GET_SCREEN`
- `SCREENSHOT`

`WAIT_MS` is a pure timing barrier for automation flows that need real elapsed time on the emulator, such as
testing long-press behavior, delayed popups, or background work transitions.

`HOLD <button> <ms>` is a stateful long-press helper. It presses the button immediately, keeps it held for the
requested duration, then releases it and completes as a barrier event.

`ACTIVATE_VISIBLE_LIST_ITEM` and `ACTIVATE_VISIBLE_MENU_ITEM` are state-driven convenience commands. They navigate
step by step using the current selected item, wait for selection changes to settle, and only then press confirm.
They also behave as barriers, so later queued commands will wait until activation completes or fails. For actions that
stay on the same screen, completion is detected from stable UI state changes such as menu/list/body/popup updates.

`GO_BACK` is a state-driven back-navigation helper. It taps the back button, waits for the activity or header to
change, and retries until the target screen changes or the timeout is reached.

`TYPE_TEXT` forwards text semantically to the current activity. Right now this is implemented for
`KeyboardEntryActivity`, which means automation can fill search/password/url prompts without simulating each key press.

`RELEASE_ALL` is a safety command for automation harnesses. It clears every held button and cancels queued tap steps,
which is useful after interrupted long-press or manual `PRESS` testing.

## Notes

- `[SIMCTL]` lines are intended for automation; other log lines may still be present.
- `--state-json` can still be used in parallel for file-based snapshots.
- Script-based input remains supported, but new automation should prefer `--control-stdio`.

## Smoke Suite

A repeatable Online Library smoke suite is available at:

```powershell
.\tools\online-library-smoke.ps1
```

Run a single case:

```powershell
.\tools\online-library-smoke.ps1 -Case browse_chapters_latest_page
```

Measure baseline timings for key Online Library flows:

```powershell
.\tools\online-library-benchmark.ps1
```

Current cases cover:

- preview cover-failure fallback on `Web Truyen`
- add-to-library and `Story Library` preview flow
- latest-page chapter selection for long chapter lists
- source-list visibility for `Truyen Full`
- `Truyen Full` search to detail flow for `Bach Luyen Thanh Tien`
- `Truyen Full` browse-chapters flow
- `Truyen Full` add-to-library to `Story Library` flow
- `Hako` download queue visibility in `Downloads`
- `Hako` search page-size and `Next Page` pagination guard
- `Hako` `Right` key behavior for `Refresh` on home feed and `Home` on search results
